pack-mssql
=======

Shinken configuration pack for Sqlserver databases

Prerequisites
========

Make sure the check_mssql_health from labs.consol.de is installed and properly configured. See http://labs.consol.de/lang/en/nagios/check_mssql_health/

As a shortcut the installation procedure for debian/ubuntu is : 

```
cd /tmp
apt-get install -y freetds-dev freetds-bin libdbi-perl libdbd-sybase-perl
sed -E -i "s/;(\s+tds version = ).*$/\1 8.0/g" /etc/freetds/freetds.conf
wget http://labs.consol.de/download/shinken-nagios-plugins/check_mssql_health-1.5.20.6.tar.gz
tar zxvf check_mssql_health-1.5.20.6.tar.gz
cd check_mssql_health-1.5.20.6
./configure --with-nagios-user=shinken --with-nagios-group=shinken --with-mymodules-dir=/var/lib/shinken/libexec --with-mymodules-dyn-dir=/var/lib/shinken/libexec
make
cp plugins-scripts/check_mssql_health /var/lib/shinken/libexec/
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/david-guenault/pack-mssql.git
shinken install --local pack-mssql
```

Usage
====

Create a host that inherit from mssql template and specifie the required configuration macros (at least _MSSQLUSER and _MSSQLPASSWORD either by modifying the $DOMAINUSER$ and $DOMAINPASSWORD$ resources macro or by replacing them by a username and a password. For security reason you should modify the resources macros instead of specifying the values in the host macro). In the following example you should replace XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX by the host name or the host ip address. It is really important to specify hostname as the host ip address or hostname (if in DNS) because the checks command use hostname and not the address. 

```
define host {
    name mssql1
    hostname XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    use mssql
}
```

Note: if you want to connect to a specific instance you must define the _MSSQLINSTANCE macro in the host definition (in the form of \INSTANCENAME).

```
define host {
    name mssql1
    hostname XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    use mssql
    _MSSQLINSTANCE \SQLEXPRESS
}
```

Exclude unwanted checks from pack
======================

If you do not want all of the checks provided by this pack you can use the service_exclude directive to filter unwanted checks (see http://shinken.readthedocs.org/en/latest/08_configobjects/host.html?highlight=service_exclude for more informations). 

```
define host {
    name mssql1
    hostname XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    address XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
    use mssql
    service_exclude Mssql-lazy-writes,Mssql-sql-recompilations
}
```
